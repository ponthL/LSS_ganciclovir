The goal of our study was to develop and validate a ML-based limited sampling strategy (LSS) approach to determine GCV AUC0–24 after administration of either intravenous GCV or oral VGCV in children.

Supplemental_figure2: Spaghetti plots representing ganciclovir concentration vs time in the simulation dataset for oral VGCV (A) or intravenous GCV (B)/
Supplemental_figure3:  The scatter plot and Bland–Altman of the MAP-BE with the different POPPK models in the test set and with real patients for predicted vs reference AUC  for VGCV (A: Franck Model in test set, B: Franck model with real patients, C: Facchin model in test set, D: Facchin model with real patients,E: Nguyen model in test set, F : Nguyen model with real patients)/
Supplemental_figure4: The scatter plot and Bland–Altman of the MAP-BE with the different POPPK models in the test set and with real patients for predicted vs reference AUC for GCV (A: Franck Model in test set, B: Franck model with real patients, C: Nguyen model in test set, C : Nguyen model with real patients)/
